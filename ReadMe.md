# Brief summary of the Data mining project for CMPSC 497


- Data cleansing and data visualization

- Utilized Cross Validation K-fold to train two logistic regression classifiers based on normalized and unnormalized features

- Applied Chi-square Test on categorical attributes and mutual information on numerical attributes to test the dependency

- Generated new features to clarify the hidden relationship in numerical features, and encoded categorical features with using one hot representation scheme

- Avoided imbalance issues in classifier training with oversampling, and performed feature selection based on the feature rank list

- Compared the performance of Decision Tree Model, Support Vector Machines and Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network with the Logistic Regression Model on both balanced and imbalanced datasets, and performed hyper-parameter tuning on Logistic Regression Model and Decision Tree Model
